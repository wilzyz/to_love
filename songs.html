                            This is a song for our anniversary. I created it in less than a day and recorded it an hour after composing it. It might seem rushed, but this is what I really want you to know: we have our ups and downs in our relationship, and I have failed from time to time. I can't count how many times I have left you, but this time will be different. We are growing as individuals, and we are growing together in our relationship. As our relationship grows, I realize that what I need to do is to be with you. I want to be there for you in your ups and celebrate with you. I want to be there when you're down, to cheer you up and support you when you need me. Thatâ€™s why in the song, I have repeated the phrase "Nandito ako," which means I want you to always remember that I am here for you, no matter what. I will always be here for you, my love.

                            If I am not mistaken, what love means to me is the first song I composed for you. Before I met you, specifically a year prior, I was broken and afraid of loving someone again. I prayed to God to show me if there was still someone I could love, someone I could be with. Then God showed me a vision of a girl I was destined to marry, and that girl was you. Before I met you, I questioned what love truly meant. But when I met you, love became clear and meaningful to me. You are the reason I love so much right now. You are the reason I didn't give up, and you are the reason I don't want to give up ever again. You gave me a reason to love again, and I thank God for that. I love you so much, more than you can comprehend.

                            I had a hard time creating or composing this because I wanted this song to be perfect for you because this is a song for your birthday. My angel is a song just for you, how I know you, how I love you so much, and how appreciate what you are. When I composed this song, I was falling harder and harder and harder because I have been thinking of you constantly for this song to be composed. That's why when I listen to this song, I smile all the time because this song is describes who you are, because for me, you are my angel, my angel that came to my life unexpectedly that I thought you're just a normal woman in my life then when I got to know you as time passed by, I came to a conclusion that you're not just an ordinary woman in my life, you are my answered prayer, you are everything that I have prayed for. I have learned so much about you that's why I composed a song for you, to remind you who you are anytime. I love you, love.

                            This song is just a random song that I have composed because I want to appreciate the things that you have done, you have been less appreciated for your achievements and I wanted to say that I'm proud of you. You're an amazing woman that have been less appreciated in your whole life, so for the rest of your life with me I want you to be appreciated every single day. I want you to know that in every achievement you have, past or present, big or small, I am proud of you for everything that you have done. I'm so proud that you are my girlfriend, I'm proud that I have an amazing girl in my life. I love you so much, love. You've been in ups and downs and you've conquered everything in your path, but I am with you now, I will be here to be proud of you, to appreciate you and to ove you for the rest of our lives. I love you always, love.
