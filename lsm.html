Dati sinasabe mo lang na baka di tayo umabot ng Christmas, okaya naman di tayo aabot ng birthday mo at kung ano ano pa HAHAHAH but now look at us, we made it! HAHAHA Hindi naman po kasi porket napaka daming pag subok eh hindi na aabot ng ilang taon haynako love HAHAHA. You just need to not give up and a lot of love! bwahahah.</h5>
                <br><h5 style=" line-height: 35px;" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1100">Did you know love? I'm so blessed to have the best girlfriend in the world. Yung kahit na galit eh kapag nangailangan ng tulong ang boyfriend niya eh aalagaan niya heheh. I'm really beyond blessed to have you, love. I can still imagine our first meet up, yung hindi natin inaakala na mag wowork pala tayong dalawa and ni wala tayong kamalay malay na magiging tayo pala HAHA. Back then parang wala lang, we thought we we're just happy in that day without a reason, but, the fact is that God destined us to meet that day was so marvelous. I still can't believe that you are my girlfriend. I thought I could never get a girlfriend again because I lost hope, but when I prayed to God and asked if there is one person for me, God literally showed you in my dreams. But God made it blurry so that I could wait for the right moment. Maybe God said that it was not the right time to reveal you yet. But then, you came into my life like a lightning passing through then love just began to nourish.</h5>
                <br><h5 style=" line-height: 35px;" data-aos="fade-up">Ang tinde noh love? Dati umamin kalang ngayon, 2 taon na mula nung umamin ka, oops, HAHAAHAH Parang kelan lang noh love, parang kelan lang nung nag chat ako na papasukin na kita sa compound niyo, tapos sabay abot mo sa palda tapos sabay tulala lang ako na naging nonchalant yung madaldal na Wilner HAHAHAH. That was the first time na na speechless ako sa sobrang ganda mo HAHAH. I was contemplating after nangyare yon na sabi ko "Bakit hindi ko siya napapansin dati eh hindi nagkakalayo mga school at churches namin" kako dati. Hanggang sa it made sense kasi God destined people who are meant to be in the right time and in the right place. And ang right place natin ay sa harap ng bahay niyo kaharap si tito, ayts HAHAHA. Our right place is nung we are happy that we thought parang wala lang siya but yon pala may rason, magkikita pala ang the one ng isat isa ayiieeee. HAHAHA. I really can't believe isang taon na tayo, we made it, love. And we shall continue our journey for the rest of our lives.</h5>
                <br><h5 style=" line-height: 35px;" data-aos="fade-up">Love, without you, everyday feels like something is missing, I always miss you when we are fighting. Every time you ignore me, you block me or what, I always miss you, at kahit pa magkaaway tayo I still crave and look for you. My hate will never be greater than my love for you. I'm so deeply in love with you, alam mo ba yon love? Syempre alam mo yon HAHAHA. I have been so addicted to you ng hindi ko din malaman ang dahilan HAHAHA. Ginayuma mo nga kasi ata ako eh HAHAH but I think I know yung ginamit mong technique eh, yung pag amin mo HAHA. All I thought eh nahihiya ka na kasi umamin ka tapos malalaman ko nalamang na trap mo lang pala yon para bumalik ako sayo at mas ipursue kita. Haist, ewan ko din sayo love eh HAAHAH. But I'm so blessed I got to be trapped by you ehe HAHA. I'm glad that you're the one that got me, love. I love you, love!</h5>
                <br><h5 style=" line-height: 35px;" data-aos="fade-up">To my one and only and the best girlfriend in the world, I wouldn't be here without you. You've encouraged me, cheer me up, lift my spirit, corrected how I should act and what I should do. I am so blessed to have you, love. I can't imagine a world without you. And just like you, I really didn't taken marriage seriously before. But when I met you, I feel like my future is bright and great. You're the only person that agreed with me to have a baby and that really shocked me because that is one of my prayer. All of my past relationships, they don't want to have kids, they don't want to be pregnant. It was a red flag for me but before, I just thought that maybe it's because they are thinking about the pain. But when you directly said that you want to have kids, I blushed and smiled really really hard and I loved you more. I can't believe that we're still together after everything that has happened to us. We have overcame obstacles upon obstacles and we always thought we couldn't take it anymore but then our love brings us back together. All through out our relationship, I really believe that God is helping us specially when we are new in our relationship. We have so many problems but then we always comeback to each other either because something happened and reminded us how much we love each other. it's like we've been guided by the Lord all this time and when we have grown in our relationship, we're coming back but because we love each other and we're not like before that we're getting consumed by emotions and always plan on leaving permanently. This time when we argue, we both know that we'll be okay again and again because these are just conflicts, problems that are temporary and we should never give up just because of a conflict okay? I love you so much, love. Kaya huwag na huwag na makikipag break please love. I love you always!</h5>
                <br><h5 style=" line-height: 35px;" data-aos="fade-up">Love, I want you to remember na nandito lang ako, nag aaway man tayo, may sakit man ako, galit man ako sayo or kahit ano pa jaan. If you need me, I'm here, okay? Kapag kailangan mo ako, wala kapong dapat ipag alala kasi kahit na ano papo iyan, I'll always reply to you as soon as possible and I'll always answer your call, okay love? So please, never hesitate to call me, never ever be selfish with your problems okay? We are together, it means kung anong problema mo, eh problema ko din, okay? We need to share our burden para hindi mahirapan ang isat isa okay? If you deny me the oppurtunity to help, then you're being too selfish, okay? Love isn't about only happiness or kilig kilig jaan. Love means in ups and downs, we are together, kahit na sabihin mong galit ako sayo tignan mo pag nag call ka tas you asked for help sasagutin ko agad yung call kahit pa nasa meeting ako or what. If I know you're not okay, I'll always prioritize you over myself kaya please, never hesitate to call me okay love? You've done enough alone, it's time to share everything with me kasi I am your ka-marites in any season, your all time bestfriend, your future husband, your nurse and doctor whenever you need care, your chef whenever you crave for something, your boyfriend that will love you until his last breathe and lastly, your lifetime partner that will always be here to help you, guide you, correct you and love you for the rest of your lives. I love you, love. There is no more greaterblessing than to have you in my life. I love you so much and I'm joyful, gratful and blessed that God chose me to be your lifetime partner. I love you, love. Happy 1st Anniversary! I love you!</h5>
