This is the most special day of our relationshi because we made it this far even if we had so many problems, struggles, arguments and conflicts. We may fight a lot but that just proves the strength of our love, our bond. God don't let problems enter our lives for no reason, God gives problems for us to conquer and in order for us to grow. Happy Anniversary, love. I hope you like my gift. I made a website that we may use for future purposes. I will publish this soon when we have the money to buy a subscription.

                    <h4 style="line-height: 35px;" data-aos="fade-up">I know wasn't a perfect boyfriend, I yelled at you, cursed at you, insulted you, hurt you, left you. You've met the worst of me that I never expected to be. I'm sorry for everything I have done and I'm sorry for the things that I have never done for you. But, the thing is, I want to grow beside you, with you. I never knew that I can still grow, I really thought before that I am a good boyfriend, but when I met you, I also met the worst in me. I prayed for a challenging girlfriend but when God gave me you, I just lost my sanity. But as time goes by, I realized that you are worth more than anything, I got angry and I tried to make you feel how you treated me which brought out the worst in me. That's the greatest thing I have regretted in my whole life. I shouldn't have thought of those things. I apologize for my behavior before. I know I'm not perfect but I'm trying to change, it might be slow but I'll change for the better not just for me but for the betterment of our relationship.</h4>
                    <br><h4 style="line-height: 35px;" data-aos="fade-up">I also want to apologize for the times that I have hurt you with my words. I adapted it when you are mad at me and made me feel that I should also treat you that way. It was immature of me and I shouldn't have done that, I should have known better. But now, I'm doing my best to control my anger. Maybe sometimes I get angry, I get upset, I overthink, but this time, I'll never forget that you are the love of my life.</h4>
                    <br><h4 style="line-height: 35px;" data-aos="fade-up">Lastly, I want to apologize for initiating not appropriate cuddles from time to time, I'm having a hard time controlling myself but I have been using a technique to distract and to avoid of myself thinking of the things we had done before which is reading the bible. The solution was not just self control but getting closer to God more and more to avoid the lust, the sin. I apologize for everything that I have done, love. I love you so much.</h4>

I know most of the time all I see is what I do in our relationship but not what you do. But I see what you do in our relationship, love. I'm grateful that you always encourage me whenever I'm down, your sudden kisses, sudden hug, everything, love. You're the girl that I had hoped for and I prayed for. Thank you for being the best girlfriend. I'm so blessed that I have you in my life.</h4>
                    <br><h4 style="line-height: 35px;" data-aos="fade-up">I want to thank you for supporting me in times that nobody believes in me. Whenever I am so down on my knees, you lifted me and revived me to stand up and fight again. You are the source of my strength, the reason I want to wake up for another day, the reason for my every smile, the reason I can't give up on our future. I love you so much, love. Thank you for everything that you have done for me. I love you always, love.</h4>
                    <br><h4 style="line-height: 35px;" data-aos="fade-up">Lastly, I appreciate your patience for me, love. I know that you are impatient but you have been so patient with me. I appreciate it when you come back to me every time you leave. It sounds funny but I really appreciate it love. It just proves how much you love. I also want to thank you for always taking the first move when we're about to have a video call. I really am not a type of guy that engages video call because I have low self esteem, so I really appreciate it love. I hope you don't get angry again because when you start to call me, I would never end your call unless I;m angry at you. But I really appreciate it love. I love you always!  </h4>
